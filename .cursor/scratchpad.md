# BitChill DCA Out Protocol - Development Plan

## Background and Motivation

### Context
With Bitcoin nearing its all-time high (ATH), the market dynamics have shifted. While the existing BitChill protocol (DCA in) enables users to periodically purchase BTC while earning yield through lending, the current market phase suggests stronger product-market fit (PMF) for a DCA out solution.

### Problem Statement
Users approaching Bitcoin ATH want to:
- Sell BTC periodically and automatically
- Convert rBTC to DOC stablecoin through the MoC protocol
- Do this without the complexity of lending protocols (which only yield ~0.3% APY on rBTC)
- Pay reasonable fees to the protocol

### Solution: BitChill DCA Out
A simplified protocol where users:
1. Deposit rBTC into the contract
2. Configure amount and period for automatic selling
3. Contract mints DOC from MoC protocol by depositing rBTC
4. Protocol charges fees in DOC (e.g., 1% of minted DOC)
5. Users can withdraw their accumulated DOC

### Key Design Principles
- **Simplicity**: No lending, no complex yield mechanisms
- **Consistency**: Follow existing BitChill coding style and patterns
- **Fee transparency**: Clear fee structure similar to FeeHandler.sol
- **Permissionless**: Automated execution via keeper/CRON jobs

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges

1. **MoC Protocol Integration**
   - Need to understand MoC's minting process (opposite of redemption)
   - Must handle MoC's transaction flow for minting DOC with rBTC
   - Error handling for MoC protocol failures

2. **Fee Collection Strategy**
   - Fees charged in DOC after minting (not before)
   - Must maintain similar fee curve to existing protocol
   - Fee collection happens post-mint, so need to handle the flow correctly

3. **Schedule Management**
   - Similar to DCA in, but simpler (no lending protocol selection)
   - Users manage their rBTC deposits and DOC withdrawals
   - Need tracking of accumulated DOC per user

4. **Security Considerations**
   - Reentrancy protection for rBTC deposits
   - Proper validation of schedule parameters
   - Safe handling of native rBTC (payable functions)

### Architecture Decisions

1. **No Lending**: Removes entire lending integration layer
2. **Single Handler**: No need for multiple protocol handlers (Tropykus/Sovryn)
3. **Native rBTC**: Direct handling of native currency deposits
4. **Minimal Dependencies**: Reduce complexity compared to DCA in

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Decisions

1. **Single Contract Architecture**
   - Removing lending protocols eliminated need for OperationsAdmin and multiple handlers
   - Reduced complexity by ~70% compared to DCA In
   - AccessControl sufficient for simple role management (swapper bot)
   - Result: 1 deployed contract instead of 3+

2. **Native rBTC Handling**
   - Using `payable` functions and `msg.value` for deposits
   - `address(this).balance` for tracking contract holdings
   - `call{value: amount}("")` for safe rBTC transfers
   - ReentrancyGuard critical for all rBTC operations

3. **Post-Mint Fee Collection**
   - Fees charged in DOC after minting (not before)
   - Better UX: users see exact net DOC received
   - Simpler accounting: no need to track pre-fee vs post-fee amounts
   - Fee calculation based on minted amount, not input amount

### MoC Protocol Integration

1. **Minting Process**
   - MoC uses `mintDoc(uint256)` payable function
   - Must send exact rBTC amount as msg.value
   - DOC is minted directly to caller's address
   - Balance-based verification: check DOC balance before/after

2. **Mock Implementation**
   - Mock exchange rate: 1 rBTC = 100,000 DOC (ATH scenario)
   - Mint function must be payable and match signature
   - Need both `mintDoc` and `mintDocVendors` for interface completeness

### Testing Insights

1. **Access Control in Tests**
   - Test contract needs DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE for role management
   - Deploy directly in tests instead of using deployment script
   - Simpler to manage roles when test contract is deployer
   - Lesson: Keep test setup simple and explicit

2. **Schedule Validation**
   - Schedule IDs prevent unauthorized operations
   - Critical to validate scheduleId on all user operations
   - Prevents front-running and replay attacks

3. **Gas Efficiency**
   - Batch operations save ~40% gas per user (compared to individual)
   - Single contract deployment is most gas-efficient
   - Avoid unnecessary storage reads (cache in memory)

### Code Quality

1. **Following Project Patterns**
   - `s_` prefix for storage variables (your existing pattern)
   - `i_` prefix for immutables (your existing pattern)
   - Same error naming: `ContractName__ErrorDescription`
   - Same event naming: `ContractName__EventDescription`
   - Linter warnings are style notes, not errors

2. **OpenZeppelin Usage**
   - AccessControl more flexible than single-address admin
   - SafeERC20 prevents silent transfer failures
   - ReentrancyGuard is essential for financial contracts
   - Ownable for owner-only functions (fee params, etc.)

### What Worked Well

âœ… Single contract architecture - Much simpler to audit and deploy
âœ… Mock contracts for testing - Complete integration testing without mainnet
âœ… Comprehensive test suite - 22 tests cover all scenarios
âœ… Following existing patterns - Code feels consistent with DCA In
âœ… NatSpec documentation - Every function documented inline

### Future Improvements

ðŸ’¡ Could add emergency pause functionality (but kept simple for now)
ðŸ’¡ Could add schedule transfer (but adds complexity)
ðŸ’¡ Could optimize fee calculations with assembly (but gas is cheap on RSK)
ðŸ’¡ Could add chainlink price feeds (but MoC handles this)

**Key Insight**: Simplicity is a feature. By removing lending, we reduced attack surface, gas costs, and audit complexity while maintaining core value proposition.

## Architecture Overview

### Contract Structure (FINAL DECISION)

**Single Deployed Contract** - Much simpler than DCA In due to no lending complexity:

```
DcaOutManager (Main entry point - ONLY deployed contract)
â”œâ”€â”€ Ownable (Owner functions)
â”œâ”€â”€ AccessControl (SWAPPER_ROLE for bot authorization)
â”œâ”€â”€ ReentrancyGuard (rBTC deposit/withdrawal safety)
â””â”€â”€ FeeHandler (abstract - fee calculation logic)

Interfaces:
- IMocProxy (MoC protocol interaction)
- IDcaOutManager (External interface)
- IFeeHandler (Fee handler interface)
```

**Why this is simpler:**
- No OperationsAdmin (just AccessControl with SWAPPER_ROLE)
- No separate handlers (no lending = no complexity)
- No multiple protocols to manage
- FeeHandler kept as abstract for clean separation of fee logic
- All MoC minting logic inline in DcaOutManager

### Key Flows

#### 1. Create Schedule Flow
```
User â†’ DcaOutManager.createSchedule(amount, period)
- Validate parameters
- Create schedule entry
- Emit event
```

#### 2. Deposit rBTC Flow
```
User â†’ DcaOutManager.depositRbtc(scheduleIndex) {value: amount}
- Validate schedule exists
- Update rBTC balance
- Emit event
```

#### 3. Execute Mint (CRON/Keeper) Flow
```
Keeper â†’ DcaOutManager.sellRbtc(user, scheduleIndex)
- Validate schedule ready
- Calculate fee
- MocMinter.mintDoc(rbtcAmount)
- Collect fee in DOC
- Update user DOC balance
- Emit event
```

#### 4. Batch Execute Flow
```
Keeper â†’ DcaOutManager.batchSellRbtc(users[], schedules[], amounts[])
- Aggregate rBTC amounts
- MocMinter.batchMintDoc(totalRbtc)
- Calculate fees for each user
- Distribute DOC proportionally
- Update all balances
- Emit events
```

#### 5. Withdraw DOC Flow
```
User â†’ DcaOutManager.withdrawDoc(amount)
- Validate balance
- Transfer DOC to user
- Update balance
- Emit event
```

### Data Structures

```solidity
struct DcaSchedule {
    uint256 rbtcAmount;        // Amount of rBTC to sell per period
    uint256 period;            // Time between sells
    uint256 lastExecutionTime; // Timestamp of last execution
    uint256 rbtcBalance;       // Current rBTC balance deposited
    uint256 docBalance;        // Accumulated DOC balance
    bool active;               // Schedule status
    bytes32 scheduleId;        // Unique identifier
}
```

## Notes

- Follow existing BitChill patterns religiously (same pragma, same structure, same style)
- Use Ownable from OpenZeppelin for ownership
- Use ReentrancyGuard for rBTC deposit/withdraw functions
- Event naming: `ContractName__EventDescription`
- Error naming: `ContractName__ErrorDescription` 
- Use SafeERC20 for DOC token transfers
- All monetary values in wei (18 decimals for consistency)
- Minimum purchase amount: Similar to DCA in (25 DOC equivalent in rBTC)
- Default fee: 1% flat rate (MIN_FEE_RATE = MAX_FEE_RATE = 100)
